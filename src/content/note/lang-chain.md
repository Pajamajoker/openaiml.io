**What it is**  
LangChain is a powerful open-source Python framework that helps developers build applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining prompts, tools, memory, and control logic into modular workflows.

**Key features**  
- **Prompt chaining:** Chain prompts and models together to build multi-step reasoning flows.  
- **Tool integration:** Plug in APIs, databases, search engines, and more using prebuilt tool wrappers.  
- **RAG support:** Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines with vector store support (FAISS, Qdrant, etc).  
- **Agent framework:** Dynamic decision-making agents that can choose tools and actions at runtime.  
- **Memory modules:** Enable stateful conversations with long-term memory and context handling.  
- **Observability:** Debug, visualize, and trace your LLM chains using LangSmith.
