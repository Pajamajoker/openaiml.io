>"DSPy is a framework from Stanford for programming language models using declarative, Pythonic modules like you would use in PyTorch. Instead of training with loss functions, DSPy modules are composed and optimized to perform complex reasoning and decision-making tasksâ€”such as question answering, text classification, or multi-hop reasoning."

>It enables **modular**, **optimizable**, and **composable** LLM workflows with built-in support for techniques like few-shot selection, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency.

>DSPy shifts the perspective: instead of seeing LLMs as black-box text generators, it encourages treating them like differentiable, tunable functions within larger systems. This opens the door to **LLM systems engineering**.

>Whether you're a researcher trying to improve benchmark scores or a developer building robust AI agents, DSPy provides the structure to iterate, optimize, and debug your LLM pipelines effectively.
