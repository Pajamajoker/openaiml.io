**What it is**  
LangGraph is a library from the LangChain team that lets you build agents and workflows using a stateful graph abstraction. Each node in the graph can be an LLM call, retriever, or any LangChain component.

**Key features**  
- **Graph-based logic:** Create multi-step workflows with branches, memory, and loops.  
- **Built on LangChain:** Seamlessly integrates with LangChain components.  
- **Concurrency support:** Run parts of the graph in parallel.  
- **Fine control:** Handle state transitions and failures easily.  
- **Perfect for agents:** Design complex tool-using agents with long-term memory.
