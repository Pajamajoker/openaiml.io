**What it is**  
Guardrails is a Python library that validates and structures LLM outputs to ensure they meet schema, quality, and safety requirements. Great for production pipelines.

**Key features**  
- **Pydantic-style schemas:** Define expected output formats easily.  
- **Re-asks:** Automatically re-run the LLM until the output is valid.  
- **Custom validators:** Add checks like regex, length, or semantic constraints.  
- **Streaming & multi-modal support:** Works with audio, image, and streaming data.  
- **Observability:** Track, log, and debug generations in real-time.
