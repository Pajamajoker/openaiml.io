## 0 · Executive TL;DR

* **TF‑IDF = TF × IDF.**  Boosts terms that are frequent **inside** a document but rare **across** the corpus.
* **It’s just a weighting scheme** inside the classic Vector‑Space Model (VSM) → every doc becomes a huge, sparse vector.
* **Cosine similarity** on those vectors gives you an instant, surprisingly good relevance ranking engine.
* Works great for *lexical* tasks (keyword search, spam filters, quick text clustering).  Falls flat when meaning, synonyms, or context matter.
* Production stack: `scikit‑learn`, `gensim`, Spark ML, Lucene/Solr/Elasticsearch.
* **BM25** = TF‑IDF++ with length normalisation & TF saturation → default in modern search engines.

## 1 · Why should I even care?

Because it’s the **hello‑world of NLP features**:

* Zero fuss: no GPUs, no embeddings, no huge pretrained models.
* Predictable: tweak stop‑words or n‑grams → see deterministic impact.
* Fast to index and query → perfect for MVPs and internal tools.

If you’ve got a log corpus or support tickets to triage, TF‑IDF will often get you that first 80 % quality in hours, not weeks.

## 2 · Intuition first, maths later

Imagine you’re reading hotel reviews.  The word **“hotel”** shows up everywhere, hardly useful for ranking.  But **“bed‑bugs”**?  Rare across the corpus, heavy inside one nasty review.  TF‑IDF gives *bed‑bugs* a punchy weight while muting boring global terms.

---

## 3 · Light‑weight maths (promise!)

\[
TF(t,d) = \frac{f_{t,d}}{|d|} \quad ; \quad IDF(t) = \log\left(\frac{N+1}{df_{t}+1}\right) + 1
\]

* \(f_{t,d}\): raw count of term *t* in doc *d*
* \(|d|\): total tokens in *d*
* \(N\): corpus size
* \(df_{t}\): docs containing *t*

Weight = TF × IDF.  Some folks drop the +1 smoothing or use log‑TF; you’re free to tweak.

## 4 · Walk‑through example (tiny corpus)

```text
Doc 0: "pune india tech scene"
Doc 1: "pune food guide"
Doc 2: "new york tech salary report"
```

1. Tokenise, lowercase, drop stop‑words.
2. Build vocab ➜ [`pune`, `india`, `tech`, `scene`, `food`, `guide`, `new`, `york`, `salary`, `report`].
3. Compute TF‑IDF → each doc becomes a 10‑dim vector.
4. Query "pune tech" → turn query into TF‑IDF vector ➜ cosine similarity ranks Doc 0 > Doc 1 > Doc 2.  Makes sense: Doc 0 contains both high‑IDF words.

*(In a real post we’d show the numeric table, but you’ll implement it in a minute.)*

## 5 · Vector‑Space Model & cosine similarity

* **Why vector space?**  Dot product & cosine distance boil down to two fast ops: multiply & sum.  Linear algebra libraries + sparse matrices = speed.
* **No training needed**.  Everything is counts + logs.
* **Cosine** focuses on angle, not length → mitigates doc size bias (though BM25 does it better).

---

## 6 · When TF‑IDF shines ✨

* Mid‑sized corpora (10² – 10⁶ docs).
* Pure lexical relevance matters: news search, FAQ matching, log deduplication.
* You want interpretable features for linear models (spam/ham, categorisation).

### When to steer clear 🚧

* Need semantics/synonyms: *car* vs *automobile* are orthogonal.
* Very long docs with boilerplate (privacy policies) → TF gets noisy.
* Multilingual corpora (different tokenisation, stop‑words).

## 7 · Pros & cons cheat‑sheet

| | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | Index in minutes. No GPUs. | Memory heavy for ultra‑large vocab. |
| **Interpretability** | Top‑weighted terms = easy to debug. | No deep semantics. |
| **Quality** | Surprisingly strong baseline for search. | Plateau at ~0.3–0.4 MAP when query mismatch synonyms. |
| **Engineering** | Integrates with linear / tree models. | Sparse → not ideal for NN unless you embed first. |

## 8 · Prod‑ready code snippets

### `scikit‑learn`
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
corpus = [...]
vect = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=2, ngram_range=(1,2), stop_words='english')
X = vect.fit_transform(corpus)  # sparse CSR matrix
```

### `gensim` streaming (large corpora)
```python
from gensim.corpora import Dictionary
from gensim.models import TfidfModel

docs = (line.split() for line in open('wiki.txt'))
dict_ = Dictionary(docs)
corpus = (dict_.doc2bow(doc) for doc in docs)
model = TfidfModel(corpus)
```

### Spark ML (cluster scale)
```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer, HashingTF, IDF
```

### Lucene / Elasticsearch
* `ClassicSimilarity` (TF‑IDF)
* `BM25Similarity` (default ≥ ES 7).

---

## 9 · Tuning tips & variants

* **Sub‑linear TF**: use log(1 + tf) to damp spicy term counts.
* **Smoothing IDF**: add‑one or add‑0.5 to avoid div‑by‑zero.
* **N‑grams/char‑grams**: capture phrases & typos.
* **Stop‑word curation**: domain‑specific stop lists ("http", "rt" in tweets).

---

## 10 · Enter BM25: TF‑IDF on steroids 🚀

### Formula (Robertson‑Sparck Jones)
\[
\text{score}(q,d) = \sum_{t \in q} IDF(t) \; \frac{ (k_1+1)\, f_{t,d} }{ k_1\big((1-b)+b\,\frac{|d|}{\mathrm{avgdl}}\big) + f_{t,d} }
\]

* **k₁** (1 – 2): TF saturation.
* **b** (0 – 1): length normalisation.

### Why better than vanilla

* Long docs no longer dominate (TF saturation).
* Explicit length penalty vs cosine.
* Tunable per‑domain.

### Quick start in Python
```python
from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
bm25 = BM25Okapi([doc.split() for doc in corpus])
print(bm25.get_top_n(query.split(), corpus, n=5))
```

### When to prefer BM25

* Ad‑hoc search & e‑commerce ranking.
* Query terms short (<5 words).
* You’re already on Lucene / ES; no extra work!

---

## 11 · Beyond BM25

* **PL2 / Dirichlet LM**: probabilistic models.
* **Dense embeddings**: BERT‑based retrievers (semantic).  Hybrid = TF‑IDF/BM25 **+** embeddings.

---

## 12 · Recap crib‑sheet 📝

1. **Tokenise → TF → IDF → multiply → normalise**.
2. Cosine similarity = quick ranking.
3. Use **sub‑linear TF** if spammers repeat words.
4. Jump to **BM25** when you care about search quality.
5. Outgrow both when semantics outrun keywords, then call embeddings.

## Let's build an intuition for this!

Imagine you’re in a sleek EVA astronaut suit, free‑floating in complete darkness. But this isn’t ordinary 3‑D space. Picture Cooper’s tesseract / blackhole scene from *Interstellar*: endless glowing strands stretch out in every imaginable direction.

* **Each strand = one word dimension.** (Basically an axis on the co-ordinate system)
* **Your TF‑IDF weight = how far you drift along that strand.**

### Building a document vector

You fire your thrusters and slide different distances along the strands for the words that actually occur in your document. Most strands you ignore; so the space feels almost empty. When you cut the thrusters, your final position in this star‑thread galaxy is a sparse coordinate list: that’s your **document vector**. (Essentially like saying move some distance x along X axis, then some distance y along Y axis and so on for all N dimensions, till you each a point where your document exists in this space, the co-ordinates for which are given by [x,y,..,n])

### Feeling cosine similarity

Now visualise two astronauts (two documents). From the origin at the centre, draw laser beams to each helmet. The **smaller the angle** between the beams, the more the astronauts are facing the same cluster of glowing strands ➜ higher cosine similarity. A right angle means their beams are orthogonal, almost no shared vocabulary.

### Why keep this picture in your head

* **Sparsity made obvious**: most dimensions = unused, so you really *feel* why indices use compressed formats.
* **Length vs direction**: cosine ignores how far you travelled and focuses on where you ended up.
* **TF‑IDF’s job**: rare but telling words tug your path further along their strand, making “bed‑bugs”‑heavy reviews cluster together.

Lock in that mental IMAX shot: whenever someone mentions “vector space,” see yourself gliding through an absurdly high‑dimensional starfield of word strands. Each glowing strand is still a word axis, every coordinate an address, but now focus on **how those addresses relate to each other**:

* **Relative position matters.**  Two documents that glide along similar strands sit at a small angle; their vocab and meaning overlap. As the angle widens, topics diverge.
* **Slicing & dicing the space.**  We choose a metric, cosine, Euclidean, dot product, or a projection like PCA/t‑SNE to carve up the galaxy. Change the cut, and “similar” shifts accordingly.
* **Finding relations.**  Clustering drops a net and groups nearby vectors. Classification draws hyper‑planes that fence spam away from ham. Search engines fire a query‑vector laser, ranking everything by angle.
* **Transformers & dense embeddings.**  Picture BERT squeezing that huge starfield into just 768 snug lanes. Points that share meaning: like “car” and “automobile” land close together, so distance itself *is* the meaning signal, even when the words don’t match.
