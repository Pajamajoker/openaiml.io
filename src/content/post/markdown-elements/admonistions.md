## What are admonitions

Admonitions (also known as "asides") are useful for providing supportive and/or supplementary information related to your content.

## How to use them

To use admonitions in Astro Citrus, wrap your Markdown content in a pair of triple colons `:::`. The first pair should also include the type of admonition you want to use.

For example, with the following Markdown:

```md
:::note
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::
```

Outputs:

:::note
Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
:::

The following admonitions are currently supported:

- `note`
